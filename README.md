## Project Overview

Service for connecting shelters/rescue operations with people looking to acquire
dogs. Preventing puppy mills from taking over on day zero should be an
interesting challenge.

The service would comprise the following:
- User profile creation/management.
  - Trust system.
  - Automatic verification of shelters to ensure legality and humane treatment.
  - Most of the referenced sites provide some sort of user profile management.
- Support for special-needs animals.
  - There is no existing solution for this.
- A listing service for available rescue animals.
  - Advanced search function to connect prospective owners of domestic animals.
  - The ASPCA provides a similar, albeit less feature-rich, service.
